Hospital-Management-System
📌 Project Overview

The Hospital Management System is a Java-based, menu-driven console application designed to simulate real-world hospital administration workflows. It manages key hospital operations such as patient records, doctor details, appointment scheduling, pharmacy management, laboratory services, staff management, and billing using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

This project demonstrates the practical application of abstraction, inheritance, collections, and structured control flow in Java.
